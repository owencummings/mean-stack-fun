MongoDb, Express, Angular, Node

Directory that shows basic development patterns for creating APIs, linking them to a database, and accessing these endpoints client-side. This particular example will run an application, server, and database on one machine which serves as an album ranking site. Install mongodb, ng, npm, and dependencies. Create your database with mongodb, build with npm build, then run client with ng serve.

All relevant code is in the /mean-app directory, with the server running from /bin/www.js and calling app.js which accesses the various Express routes and MongoDB models.
